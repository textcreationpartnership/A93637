            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

firſt <hi>hum—hauc</hi>—you muſt underſtand, (which I ſhould have been loth you ſhould, but that you know alreadie) That I was the Son of a <hi>Brewer,</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Elie,</hi> which I need not to have told you, for it is viſibly to be ſeen in my <hi>Noſe,</hi> being the colour of his <hi>Copper;</hi> I am loth to ſay ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He, or I were Gentlemen, becauſe many here would be apt to give me the lye. However, for my part I followed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies Gentlemens exerciſes; Swearing, Whoreing, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other the like commendable qualities, whilſt I was a young man; When I grew more in years, I grew more cunning, and having play'd the Fools part before, I play'd the Knaves now; and by my plauſible carriage, and oppoſing in a high nature all Government and Order in Church and State, I won the love, and notice of all the Hair-brain'd Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries of thoſe times, (who afterwards was very ſerviceable to my ambitious thoughts, And to let you know what little reaſon I have to love learning, I was expel'd the <hi>Univerſitie,</hi> but I think I was even with them ſince.</p>
                        <p>I was forthwith made a Committee-man, and how I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved my ſelf therein, is notoriouſly known. I think I did not at all ſwerve from the firſt conſtitution of that Office, as you may read in that elegant Character of a Committee-man, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Mr. <hi>John Cleaveland,</hi> to which I refer you. But I was not contented with this preferment alone, which made me ſeek further, (and indeed though I have none of the beſt Faces, I quickly found 'twas well approved off for a Warlike or Ammunition Face, having the advantage of a light from my <hi>Noſe,</hi> in all dark, and Warlike Stratagems, (not excepting Plundering itſelf) by which I quickly found a nearer way to get Wealth, then by Brewing; For I fell to hopping from a Captaine to a Collonel, and ſo on till I got to be a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; and now I am fairly hop't hither, what cheats I acted on

in law to be <hi>Dick</hi> his Son: but when <hi>I</hi> informed him he formerly went by another name in his youth, he quickly remembred him, but why ſhould I trouble you with this at this time: I am come hitherto give an account to the Law for my former tranſactions, ('tis ſtrange a man ſhould give account for that he never cared for) but although you may for breach of them condemn me, and theſe my Friends, yet we have very good Friends whither we are going, and ſuch as love thoſe beſt, as are of our Principles: And now I ſpeak of Principles; I ought to tell you what they are, but you know them too well already, however I muſt be talking if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do any thing. Well, were our Army alive, I think we ſhould not ſtand thus on Confeſſions; but it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not, we have not been aſhamed of worſe actions then theſe, and why ſhould we be afraid now: We have that I am ſure in us will carry us through ten thouſand of theſe diſgraces, and bring us ſafe to our own homes; We have <hi>I</hi> aſſure you a remnant left among you, that will ſtand for and juſtifie us, though at laſt they ſtand where we do: A remnant I ſay of thoſe Agitating ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that were in my dayes, that will ſtand cloſe by the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> though they are ſure to meet with Hell and Damnation in the end, which they need not doubt of; and if you all well underſtood your ſelves, you would be of my minde; <hi>Friends,</hi> wonder not if I have not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd any thing of Religion, for I ſo much loved the thing, that I ever hated the name, and am an utter enemie to all that pretend to it; and for the Law, <hi>I</hi> think in all my actions you may ſee <hi>I</hi> never owned that: But indeed, <hi>I</hi> had almoſt forgot to tell my title of Honour, which was Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland, Noll Cromwells</hi> own ſon (though

                        <p>I Am here become a ſad Spectacle to you this day, and indeed I ever thought I ſhould arive here one day; If I ſhould tell you where I was born, it would be to no purpoſe, becauſe my Country hath diſowned me; I was bred to the profeſſion of the Law, a <hi>Judge,</hi> nay, a <hi>Preſident</hi> too, and all to ſerve this old Gentleman, (poynting to <hi>Cromwell.</hi>) I found out the firſt invention for giving opprobrious, wicked, and villanous language to Kings; for which we are now come to a recompence here, but ſeeing our deſigns thrive no better here, we will ſee what we can do in the other World. And truly, I am only now ſorry that this good Gentleman, and I ſhould ever differ, conſidering we ſerv'd both one Maſter, and how alike we were in every thing, not only in our Faces, but even in our very lives and death, being all of a mettle too. But the truth is, he had a King in his Belly, and I had a Common-wealth in mine; and to tell you, I thought by it, I was the biger man, and yet I muſt ſtudy the confuſion of the Law on the top of <hi>Weſtminſter-Abby,</hi> in a little Room; and he muſt have all <hi>Whitehall</hi> to himſelf; indeed Friends, you cannot but judge this unjuſt, and this was the riſe of our

difference, and though he made me croſſe the Cudgells to him, yet at laſt I got poſſeſſion of <hi>White</hi>-Hall, and a <hi>Preſident</hi> I was there too, for I cannot love to go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in my honours, for the ſame place is kept for me where I am going, elſe I ſhould quarel there too, and ſet all in a flame; and if Old <hi>Nick</hi> be not too cunning for us, we ſhall ſpoile his Monarchy, and make it a Chriſtian Common-wealth. And truly I think <hi>James Harrington</hi> hath hit it as well as may be, and for my part, I was angry he did not put my Name as Author of it, becauſe I was ever noted that way beyond him; and now to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner of the Great Seal, is a fine thing indeed, I hope I ſhall have that place too, elſe I ſhall not be pleaſed, and beſides there's a great deal of reaſon for it, nor do I co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet to have all neither, but my ſhare, my ſhare. But Gentlemen, I am too too worldly at this place; you expect to hear ſomewhat of my Religion, and for my part, I never knew any ſuch thing in a Common-wealth, except the Jewiſh Religion, and truly that I would be ſooneſt of, did I love any, becauſe they Crucify'd their King; and truly I may be thought a Jew for the ſame thing; but though I love the practice, I hate the Religion, it having been ſo much defaced in my Dear Friend and Brother <hi>Miles Corbet;</hi> as to the love of my Country, indeed I would do much for her, and if ſhe would but go with me where I am going, I am confident I could procure her to be the Senior Common-wealth, and ſhould take place of <hi>Holland,</hi> in ſpite of their Butter Boxes, although <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſſe they are to be highly commended too, for their Religion.</p>
                        <p>Thus far you may eaſily underſtand me, I think, and were I not ſufficiently known, I ſhould tell you much more, but I think there is one generall miſtake among you

all, in thinking me to be an able Lawyer, indeed Friends I muſt needs clear meſelf, and profeſſe my ignorance of that, which my thinks you may eaſily underſtand by my continual practice againſt either Law or Reaſon, and therefore that doubt is eaſily clear'd: Truly Friends, my caſe now, may be ſome of yours hereafter, and therefore I tell you one thing for your comfort, you talk, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny talk of a thing call'd Conſcience, trouble of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; truly I muſt tell you, I beleeve there is no ſuch thing, if there were, ſure I might have been acquainted with it, having ventured far in ſearch of it; thereof take my counſel and courſe, and you will never fear that, and indeed 'tis only a fear.
